# Maze Solver

Maze Solver Pathfinding Visualizer is a personal project that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal path in a maze. The web application allows users to generate random mazes, build mazes themselves, and visualize how the algorithm finds the shortest path. The website is built using React.js for the frontend and Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding. Maze Solver Pathfinding Visualizer is [live](https://mazesolver-kevindrayana.netlify.app/) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kevindrayana/Maze-Solver).

## Features of Maze Solver

- Generate random mazes
- Build maze manually by clicking the mouse
- Visualize the algorithm finding the shortest path in real time
- Change the speed of visualization
- Reset the maze to generate a new one

## How Maze Solver works

1. Marks the starting node as "open" and calculates distance from start to itself as zero.
2. Checks all unvisited neighboring nodes, calculates distance and marks them as "open".
3. Continues this until it finds the ending node.
4. The path is then traced back from the end node to the start node.


## Conclusion

Maze Solver Pathfinding Visualizer is an interactive web application that implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the optimal path in a maze. With features like generating random mazes, building mazes manually, and visualizing the algorithm finding the shortest path in real time, this project is an excellent tool for learning about pathfinding. The web application is built using React.js and the source code is available on GitHub. Overall, Maze Solver Pathfinding Visualizer is a fun and engaging way to learn about complex algorithms and pathfinding.
