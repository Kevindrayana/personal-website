## How Phone Shop Works

Phone Shop is built on the Angular framework, which is a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. The application uses Angular's components, services, and routing to manage state and handle user interactions. The item data is stored in a JSON file and is retrieved using Angular's HTTP client.

When a user clicks on an item, the app sends a request to the server to retrieve the item's details from the JSON file. The app then displays the item's details on the page. When a user adds an item to the cart, the app updates the cart's total price and item count. The user can then view their cart and checkout when they are ready to make a purchase.
